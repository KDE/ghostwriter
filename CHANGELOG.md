## [1.6.0] - 2018-04-07

### Added

* HTML live preview is now in a split pane view rather than in a separate window.
* New options were added to hide HUD windows while typing, in full screen mode, or in live preview mode.
* A new button was added to the status bar and a new shortcut was added to the View menu in the menu bar to toggle hiding/showing the open HUDs.
* Github's cmark-gfm can now be detected and used as a Markdown processor.
* Block quotes and code blocks now have an inobtrusive background color to differentiate them.
* Buttons have been added to the status for existing features.
* HUD windows and scrollbars can be stylized to have square or rounded corners in the Settings, and are no longer theme dependent.
* New "Typewriter" focus mode was added by @hirschenberger.
* The style sheet and Markdown processor to use with the HTML live preview can now be selected in their own dialog box accessible both from the status bar at the bottom of the window and from the menu bar in the Settings menu.
* The "Copy HTML" button has been moved to the "status bar" at the bottom of the main window.
* The "Copy HTML" button / menu bar option can copy just the selected Markdown text as HTML (using the currently selected Markdown processor). It will still copy the entire Markdown text document and convert it to HTML in the system clipboard if no text is selected.
* Themes now support options for emphasis color and block text color. Note that emphasis color will also affect the color of headings, and block text color will affect the color of block quotes and code blocks.

### Fixed

* Issue #302: ghostwriter will now look for default Qt translations on the standard Qt translations path (for standard buttons/text). These default Qt translations have been included in the Windows installer translations folder and portable Windows Zip, and will be loaded automatically based on the currently selected application language.
* Some tweaks have been made to the parsing/highlighting of emphasized text to handle nested emphasis cases better. As part of this effort, ghostwriter uses a Qt 5-specific regular expression class that is not available in Qt 4. As such, ghostwriter can no longer be built with Qt and must be built with Qt 5.
* Issue #272: Fixed issue with Focus mode where inserting matching characters around a selection was causing the application to crash.
* Issue #260: Added compatibility with Pandoc version 2 and MultiMarkdown version 6.
* Fixed issue where HTML preview scrolls to the top if the new HTML from a modified document matches the old HTML, even if the markup used in the source document did change.
* Fixed issue where current word is not live spell checked if the user switches the text cursor to a different line.
* Fixed issue where prompt to reload a file that has been modified externally was being displayed multiple times per file change. This seems to have been triggered by some editors like Sublime Text that perform multiple file saves for a single file modification.
* Issue #228: Selected text can now be dragged and dropped to a different location within the editor.
* Fixed issue where if setext heading markup line is selected and deleted with the cursor position beginning at the end of the previous line, the heading is not removed from the Outline HUD.
* Fixed issue where Preview HTML menu item and button were not in sync to appear checked or unchecked.
* ghostwriter now clears the Outline HUD when loading or reloading a document to prevent a crash in case bad data is in the HUD.
* Fixed copy HTML issue to ensure Markdown text has proper formatting (i.e., greater than signs aren't converted to `&gt;`).
* ghostwriter will now search in the mozilla-dicts installation location for dictionaries on OpenBSD.

## [1.5.0] - 2017-05-13

### Added

* Most settings have been moved into a new Preferences dialog to accommodate the ever increasing number of application options.

* When passing in a file path via the command line, a new file will be created with that path if it does not already exist.

* Various performance enhancements and tweaks have been made under the hood.
