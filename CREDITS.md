## Special Thanks

Graeme Gott, Dmitry Shachnev, and Gabriel M. Beddingfield were all indirectly my mentors in learning Qt by providing excellent code from which I could lift.

I am also deeply indebted to Wolf Vollprecht, the author of [UberWriter](http://uberwriter.wolfvollprecht.de/), for the inspiration he provided in creating such a beautiful Markdown editing tool.
